***
The notebook has comments before each cell to describe what’s happening in the cell
***
The Dataset are stored in 4 different folders, for making final predictions only dataset 2,3 and 4 are used.
***
I have commented the generation of a few plots, as it takes most of the computation time.
You can skip the print statements as well.
